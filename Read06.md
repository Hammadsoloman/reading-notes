# Read: 06 - JS Object Literals; the DOM

## Chapter 3: “Object Literals”

**I learned in this chapter:**

It consists of four main types of nodes.

* Each node is an object with methods and properties.
* Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file).
* Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser

* get El ementByid () al lows you to select a single element node by specifying the value of its
id attribute.

* When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).
* When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is known as traversing the DOM.

* Using the i nnerHTML property, you can access and amend the contents of an element, including any child elements.

In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
