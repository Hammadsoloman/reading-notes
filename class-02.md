# Read: 02 - HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## Chapter 2: “Text”

*in this chapter you will learn more about:*

1- **Headings and paragraphs** .
2- **Bold, italic, emphasis** .
3- **Structural and semantic markup** .

### after this Chapter you will be learn this points :
* HTML elements are used t XX o describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of anyacronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

## Chapter 10:  “Introducing CSS”

*in this chapter you will learn more about:*

1- **What CSS does**
2- **How CSS works**
3- **Rules, properties, and values**

## after this Chapter you will be learn this points :

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

# Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions”

### In this chapter, you will start learning to read and write JavaScript. You will also learn how to give a web browser
instructions you want it to follow.

#### THE LANGUAGE:
**SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR** : like any new language, there are new words to learn (the vocabulary) and rulesfor how these can be put together (the
grammar and syntax of the language).

#### GIVING INSTRUCTIONS:
**FOR A BROWSER TO FOLLOW** : Web browsers (and computers in general) approach tasks in a very different way than a human might. Your instructions need to
reflect how computers get things done.

*We will start with a few of the key building blocks of the language and look at how they can be used to write some very basic scripts (consisting of a few simple steps) before going on to
look at some more complex concepts in subsequent chapters.*


## after this Chapter you will be learn this points :

1- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
2- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
3- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
4- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
5- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
6- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
7- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”

### Looking at a flowchart (for all but the most basic scripts), the code can take more than one path, which means the browser runs different code in different situations. In this
chapter, you will learn how to create and control the flow of data in your scripts to handle different situations.

#### Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often
rely upon the following three concepts:
**EVALUATIONS**
* You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note the match expected results. *
**DECISIONS**
* Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down. *
**LOOPS**
* There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly. *

## after this Chapter you will be learn this points :
1- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
2- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
3- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
4- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of codeif a condition is true, and another if it is false.
5- switch statements allow you to compare a valueagainst possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
6- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
7- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
8- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
