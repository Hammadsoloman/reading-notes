# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure”

*In this chapter you will be able to:*
1- **Understanding structure.** 
2- **Learning about markup.**
3- **Tags and elements.**

*And in more details you will learn more about:*
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup”

*In this chapter you will be able to:*
a- **Specifying different versions of HTML** 
b- **Identifying and grouping elements**
c- **Comments, meta information and iframes**

*And in more details you will learn more about:*
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

## HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout”

*In this chapter you will be able to:*
1- **HTML5 layout elements** 
2- **How old browsers understand new elements**
3- **Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS**

*And in more details you will learn more about:*
* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

## JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming”

## How JS makes Web Page More Interactive ? 

#### ACCESS CONTENT

*You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:*

• Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page.
• Select any elements that have a c 1 ass attribute with a value of note.
• Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has avalue of emai1.

#### MODIFY CONTENT

*You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:*

• Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element.
• Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements.
• Change the size or position of an <i mg> element.

#### PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect values from a fo rm, perform acalculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport).


### How do I write ascript for a web page? 

1- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
2- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
3- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
