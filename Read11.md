## Chapter 16: “Images”

**I learned from this chapter:**

* The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

* The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

* The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.

* The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which can make the web page load faster.

* Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.



## Chapter 19: “Practical Information” 

**I learned from this chapter:**

* SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.

* In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.

* Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.

* As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.

* The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.

* As the name suggests, File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows you to transfer files across the Internet from your computer to the web server hosting your site.
