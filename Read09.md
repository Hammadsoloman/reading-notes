# Read: 09 - Forms and Events

## Chapter 6: “Events”

**I Learned From This Chapter:**

* Because you cannot have parentheses after thefunction names in event handlers or listeners,passing arguments requires a workaround.
* IES-8 had a different event model and did not support addEventL i stener() but you can provide fallback code to make event listeners work with older versions of IE.
* When an event occurs, the event object tells you information about the event, and the element it happened upon.
* Creating event listeners for a lot of elements can slow down a page, but event flow allows you to listen for an event on a parent element.

## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms”

**I Learned From This Chapter:**
* You can specify an image to act as a bullet point using the list-style-image property.
* Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
* Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
* Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

## Chapter 7: “Forms”
**I Learned From This Chapter:**
* There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site.
* The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.
* The <textarea> element is used to create a mutli-line text input. Unlike other input elements this is not an empty
  element. It should therefore have an opening and a closing tag.
* The <select> element is used to create a drop down list box. It contains two or more <option>elements.
* When introducing form controls, the code was kept simple by indicating the purpose of each one in text next to it. 
  However, each form control should have its own <label> element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users.
