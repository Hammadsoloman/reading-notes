# Read: 08 - More CSS Layout

## Ch. 15, “Layout”

**I learned from this chapter** : 
* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
* Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
* When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on the page. (They act like it is not there.)
* The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing
element as possible.
* The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand
sides of a box. 
* Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
* Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser
window. They tend to use percentages.
