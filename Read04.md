# Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links”
**The main things that I learned from this chapter is** :
•	Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
And we use (mail to) for linking email.

•	Target; we use it If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

•	How I could link to a Specific Part of the Same Page.


## Chapter 15: “Layout”

**The main things that I learned from this chapter are**:
•	There are different ways to position elements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.

•	Various devices have different screen sizes and resolution, and how this affects the design process.

•	Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.



## Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects”

**The main things that I learned from this chapter are**:
•	Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

•	Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected.
           If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression,
           (e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression.
