# Read: 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Chapter 5: “Images”
**I learned a lots of things in the chapter**:

* Choosing the right format, Optimizing images for the web.
* Include an image in my web pages using HTML.
* The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height     that you want them to appear on the page.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are    better saved as GIFs.


## Chapter 11: “Color”

**I learned a lot of things in the chapter**:

•	How to specify colors, as there are three common ways in which you can indicate your choice of colors (plus extra ways made available in CSS3).

•	When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

•	CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.



## Chapter 12: “Text”

**I learned a lot of things in the chapter**:
 * When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.

 * Browsers are supposed to support at least one typeface from each of  the groups above. For this reason, it is common to add the generic fontname after your preferred choice of typefaces.

 * You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. 
 
 * Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
