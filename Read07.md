## Chapter 6: “Tables” 

**I Learned From This Chapter:**

* A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.

* The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)

* The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

* For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.



## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects”

**I Learned From This Chapter:** 

* To update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets.

* They work on objects created using literal or constructor notion.

* The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.

* When a function is created at the top level of a script (that is, not inside another object or function), then it is in the global scope or global context.

* In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.
